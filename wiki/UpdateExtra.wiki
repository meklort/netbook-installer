#summary Explains what UpdateExtra is for.

= Introduction =

NetbookInstaller has a very specific method for updating kexts that are used. We use a total of three kext caches throughout the system. The first, the boot cache, it generated from /System/Library/Extensions just like in a real mac. No kexts installed by NetbookInstaller are ever in that cache. The second kext cache is /System/Library/Extensions.mkext. The only kexts in here are from the /System/Library/Extensions/ directory. The last  kext locations, inside, /Extra, houses all of the kexts installed by NetbookInstaller.


= Details =

UpdateExtra is used to regenerate *every* kext cache used by the bootloader. The fist two kext caches mentioned above or only regenerated for a just-in-case scenario. They aren't touched by NetbookInstaller, but you never know what (or who) might modify them.

In order to add or remove a kext, do the following:
# Open a finder window
# Press cmd + shift + G
# Type /Extra in the window that appeared in from the above command and hit enter.
# Copy any kexts you want to /Extra/<machineName>Ext/
# Run /Extra/UpdateExtra.app to rebuild the extension cache.
